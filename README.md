### A little bit about me and what I have been up to!ğŸ‘‹âš¡ğŸ˜„ğŸ“«ğŸ’¬ğŸ¤”ğŸ‘¯ğŸŒ±ğŸ”­

My live goal in my younger years was seeing as many cultures as possible and living in as many countries as I could.
That resulted in me going to Australia and New Zealand for about four years in total.
I have lived, worked and met new people at different places in those countries but I always knew I wanted have a life in the Netherlands.
These experiences have formed me to the person I am right now, I have learned to handle stress well, I have always worked for what I wanted and it is in my nature to be curious, what results in a non stop learning circle!

Experiencing differend experiences made me realise there is more then Hospitality, so I decided to start a new adventure at hogeschool Novi.
What resulted in finding a new passion: Programming! 
I love the endless solutions, what allows me to be creative and I realise the learning curve is endless, what makes me enthausiastic!
I cant wait for my next step, as I am currently finishing the bootcamp.

The lagnuages I am learning are HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, Java and SQL

In my repository you will find some of the projects Novi gafe me and if you want to ask me any questions, dont hesitate to contact me!
